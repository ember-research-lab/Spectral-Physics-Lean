# Concrete Identification of the Spectral-Action Constant `K`

The `BridgeConjecture` from `Bundle/SpectralAction.lean` is parametrized
by an abstract constant `K` such that

    `y_c · dim(16) = K · c_2(P_SM)`,    `y_τ = K`

i.e. `K` is the "lepton-sector proportionality constant". This file
identifies `K` concretely in terms of the spectral action's structure.

## What `K` is

In the Connes-Chamseddine spectral action, the `Λ²` coefficient has
two parts:

  `a_2 = -V_M · R/6 · Tr_F(I) - V_M · Tr_F(D_F²)`     (Yukawa block)

The Yukawa contribution `Tr_F(D_F²)` decomposes by SU(3)-rep over the
16-spinor as

  `Tr_F(D_F²) = Σ_f mult_f · y_f² = N_c · Σ_q y_q² + Σ_l y_l²`

(quark contribution × N_c colors + lepton contribution).

The Λ⁰ Pontryagin coefficient is

  `a_4_pontryagin = κ · ∫_M tr(F ∧ F) = 8π² κ · c_2(P)`

for some `κ` depending on the cutoff `f_0` and the Tr_F structure.

The framework's matching condition (the `BridgeConjecture`) is

  `(d/dy_τ) [Yukawa contribution] = (d/dy_c) [Yukawa contribution] / dim(16)
                                    × c_2(P_SM) / N_c`

Equivalently: **the lepton-sector linear coefficient = K = mult(y_τ)·V_M
in the appropriate normalization**.

## What this file does

* States the structure of `K` in terms of `f_0, f_2, f_4` and Tr_F data.
* Proves that the framework's `mult(y_c)/mult(y_τ) = N_c` identity, when
  combined with the matching condition, gives exactly the
  `y_c · dim(16) = K · c_2(P_SM)` form.

## Decl classification (content-repair-2b)

* **DEFINITIONAL / ARITHMETIC**: algebraic equivalences linking `K`,
  `mult`, and `Tr_F` (including `y_c/y_τ = 3/16` as an `iff` rewrite).
* **SHELL**: `KIdentification` is vacuous (disclosed 2026-06-09).
* **SHELL / Tier-3**: spectral-action expansion that would pin `K`.

/-- A normalization constant `K` extracted from the spectral action's
    Λ²-coefficient, the cutoff-moment data, and the Tr_F structure of
    the lepton sector. -/

  /-- `K` is positive (since it scales with cutoff moments and dim H_F > 0). -/
  K_pos : 0 < K

/-- PLACEHOLDER / VACUOUS (disclosed 2026-06-09 hygiene pass) — the body
    `∃ c, 0 < c ∧ K = c·Λ²·f₂` is trivially satisfiable: since `K`, `Λ²`
    and `f₂` are all positive, the witness `c := K/(Λ²·f₂)` ALWAYS
    exists. The class therefore constrains nothing and is a content-free
    shell. (The 2026-05-03 AUDIT.md claim that this is "non-vacuous"
    was wrong — positivity of `c` does not save it; see the dated
    correction note in AUDIT.md.)

    Intended (unformalized) content: in the Connes-Chamseddine action,
      `K = (Λ² · f_2) · V_M / 6 · (mult-weighted lepton-sector data)`
    with a *specific* `c` computed from the cutoff function — pinning
    `c` to that value is what would make this class substantive. -/

/-! ## Connection to the multiplicity ratio

The framework's `BridgeConjecture` (in `Bundle/ChernSimons.lean`)
required `y_c · dim(16) = K · c_2(P_SM)`. Combining this with
`mult(y_c) / mult(y_τ) = N_c` (from `MultiplicityRatio.lean`) gives a
constraint that the Yukawa-multiplicity-weighted contribution per
generation matches: -/

/-! ## The clean form of the matching identity

**Honest finding.** A naive "multiplicity-weighted matching"
`y_c · mult(charm) = K · mult(τ) · N_c` collapses to `y_c = y_τ`
(since `mult(charm)/mult(τ) = N_c`), which is empirically wrong.

The framework's actual matching identity is **simpler**:

  `y_c · dim(16) = y_τ · c_2(P_SM)`        (= `16 y_c = 3 y_τ`)

i.e. exactly the BridgeConjecture form. The factor `c_2(P_SM) = 3` already
encodes the topology; the multiplicity ratio `N_c = 3` is the numerical
coincidence that the SM has `N_gen = N_c`, *not* an extra factor in the
matching. -/

/-- **DEFINITIONAL / ARITHMETIC** — re-export of `normalization_iff_ratio`:
    `16 y_c = 3 y_τ` ↔ `y_c/y_τ = 3/16`. Not a Tier-1 derivation of the ratio. -/

    ↔ y_c / y_τ = (3 : ℝ) / 16 :=

/-! ## What this gives us

The bridge derivation chain is now:

```
Spectral action's lepton sector  ↦  K = y_τ              (via Λ² coefficient)
Spectral action's Λ⁰ Pontryagin  ↦  16 y_c = 3 K           (via gauge sector)
                                    ⇕
                                  y_c/y_τ = 3/16
```

The two arrows correspond to the Tier-3 hypotheses
`KIdentification` and `PontryaginCoefficientIsCharge`. -/

/-- **SHELL / DEFINITIONAL** — restates `bridge_clean_form` with decorative
    typeclass arguments. Conclusion `y_c/y_τ = 3/16` comes from the `iff`
    applied to the supplied matching hypothesis; the hypothesis is not derived.

    and `[PontryaginCoefficientIsCharge …]` are unused; load is on
