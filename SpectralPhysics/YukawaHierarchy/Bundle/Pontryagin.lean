# Pontryagin / Second Chern Character — Scaffolding

For a connection on a principal SU(N) bundle, the second Chern character
(equivalently, the Pontryagin number when the structure group is real)
is

    `c_2(P) = (1 / 8π²) ∫_M tr(F ∧ F)`

valued in `ℤ` for closed 4-manifolds with the standard normalization.

This file collects the **typed identities** between the bundle's
topological charge `chargeNumber` (already declared in `PrincipalBundle.lean`)
and `c_2(P)`, and the Chern-Simons `dω₃ = c_2(F)` Stokes-theorem identity.

## What this gives us

A clean Lean statement of:
   `c_2(BPST_SU3) = 1`
   `c_2(physicalSM_SU3) = 3`
   `dω₃ = c_2(F)`  (Chern-Weil, Tier 3 hypothesis)

These are the bridge between the topological side (`Bundle/`) and the
representation-theoretic side (`SO10Decomposition`, `MultiplicityRatio`).

## Tier classification

* **Tier 1 (proved)**: identifications between
  `bundle.chargeNumber` and named structural quantities (decidable
  equalities for specific bundles).
* **Tier 3 (hypothesised)**: the analytic content (Chern-Weil, integration)
  is encoded as `class` predicates with no proof.

/-! ## Second Chern character as data -/

/-- The second Chern character of a principal G-bundle, packaged as
    a structure carrying the integer value. For SU(N) on a closed
    4-manifold, this equals the topological charge / instanton number. -/

/-! ## Tier-1 identifications -/

/-- **Tier 1.**  The second Chern character of `BPST_SU3` equals its
    bundle charge number. -/
theorem c2_BPST_SU3_eq_charge :
    SecondChernCharacter.ofBPST_SU3.value = BPST_SU3.chargeNumber := rfl

/-- **Tier 1.**  Same for the physical SM bundle. -/
theorem c2_physicalSM_eq_charge :
    SecondChernCharacter.ofPhysicalSM.value = physicalSM_SU3.chargeNumber := rfl

/-! ## The Chern-Weil dω₃ = c_2 identity (Tier-3 hypothesis) -/

/-- **Tier 3 hypothesis.**  Chern-Weil theorem: the exterior derivative
    of the Chern-Simons 3-form is the Pontryagin/second-Chern density.
    On a closed 4-manifold, integrating gives the Stokes identity
    `∫_M c_2(F) = ∫_{∂M} ω₃` for any chosen primitive.

    For S⁴ (no boundary), this becomes the topological-charge identity
    `∫_{S⁴} c_2 = winding(g : S³_∞ → SU(N))` for any "ball-removal"
    boundary representation. -/

/-! ## Connection to `BridgeConjecture` (the bundle side of `r_c/r_τ = 3/16`) -/

/-- **Tier 1 (organisational).**  Express the `BridgeConjecture` numerator
    `(ChernSimons3Form.ofPhysicalSM).boundaryIntegral` as the bundle's
    second Chern character. This is the cleanest way to read the bridge:

        `y_c / y_τ = c_2(P_SM) / dim(16) = 3/16`. -/
